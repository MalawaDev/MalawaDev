## Hello, i'm Malawa
I'm a student who loves coding and drawing pixel-art in my spare time.

I've been programming random things since a while ago, but some of my favourites are:

- Discord bots (on JS)
- Unity games
- Mods (mostly MC)

I am also trying to use git more, because sometimes -in small projects mostly- i don't use it, and i think it's a good practice.
